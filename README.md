Apologies for the profanity.

Inspired by several intriguing series of challenges on Codewars, this interpreter is the first step in a personal project to learn more
about esoteric programming languages (esolangs) by writing my own interpreters in python. MiniStringFuck is a very simple language, with
only two commands, operating on a single memory cell: "+" increments the value of the memory cell, which will wrap back to zero when it 
reaches 256.  "." will print out the current ASCII value of the memory cell. More information (though there isn't much) can be found at
https://esolangs.org/wiki/MiniStringFuck. More information on esolangs in general can be found here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language.
